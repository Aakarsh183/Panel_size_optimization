Battery Electric Vehicle (BEV) Solar Charging Optimization Project

Description: Developed a simulation to optimize the size of a solar panel for charging a BEV driven 200 km daily (100 km in the morning and 100 km in the evening) for commuting purposes.

Key Contributions:
Calculated the energy requirements based on a BEV with a 100 kWh battery and 0.18 kWh/km electricity consumption.
Implemented an optimization model to determine the optimal size of the solar panel needed to fully charge the vehicle during the day.
Analyzed the impact of different driving and charging patterns on energy consumption and solar panel efficiency.
